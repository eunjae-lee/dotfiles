# Migration: __NAME__
#
# This file can contain either:
# 1. A single migration (one provider block)
# 2. Multiple migrations (array of provider blocks)
#
# All migrations in this file will be executed in order and tracked as one unit.
#
# Available providers: sh, brew, mas, repo, symlink
#
# See examples below and uncomment/modify as needed.

# ============================================================================
# SINGLE MIGRATION EXAMPLE
# ============================================================================

# Shell command provider - execute any shell commands
provider: sh
command: |
  # Your migration code here
  echo "Migration: __NAME__"
# interactive: true  # Set to true if you need to prompt for user input

# ============================================================================
# MULTIPLE MIGRATIONS EXAMPLE (uncomment to use array format)
# ============================================================================

# Use this format when you have multiple related steps:
#
# - provider: sh
#   command: |
#     echo "Step 1: Preparation"
#     mkdir -p ~/.config
#
# - provider: brew
#   packages:
#     - vim
#     - git
#   casks:
#     - visual-studio-code
#
# - provider: mas
#   apps:
#     - name: "Xcode"
#       id: 497799835
#
# - provider: sh
#   command: |
#     echo "Step 4: Finalization"

#
#   # Configure git
#   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
#
#   # Create directories
#   mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim
# interactive: true  # Set to true to allow user input (read prompts)

# --- Homebrew Provider (brew) ---

# packages:
#   - vim
#   - neovim
#   - tmux
#   - fzf

# --- Repository Provider (repo) ---
# Clone git repositories
#
# provider: repo
# repos:
#   - url: git@github.com:user/repo.git

#     path: "~/projects/another"

# --- Symlink Provider (symlink) ---
# Create symbolic links
#
# provider: symlink
# links:
#   - source: "~/workspace/dotfiles/.gitconfig"
#     target: "~/.gitconfig"
#   - source: "~/workspace/dotfiles/.zshrc"
#     target: "~/.zshrc"
#     force: true  # Delete target if it exists (file or directory)

# ============================================================================
# TIPS
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. Make migrations idempotent - check if things exist before creating
# 2. Test with: dots apply --dry-run
# 3. Use arrays for tightly coupled operations
# 4. Use separate files for independent operations
# 5. Add comments to explain complex operations
# 6. Keep migrations focused on one logical task
